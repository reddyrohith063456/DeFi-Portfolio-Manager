## Overview

This project presents a responsive React-based **DeFi dashboard** for managing and analyzing decentralized finance investments. It tracks real-time token values (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC), calculates **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)** and **ARP (Annual Return Percentage)**, and visualizes historical trends, impermanent loss, and portfolio health metrics.

## Features

- **Real-Time Portfolio Updates** with token price integration
- **APY vs ARP Charts** for strategy comparison
- **Impermanent Loss Tracking** over time
- **Personalized Insights** to optimize staking and liquidity pool positions
- **Secure Access** with smart contract audit support and multi-factor authentication
- 25% simulated increase in yield farming performance
- 20% boost in investor returns through optimized rebalancing

##  Dataset

A sample dataset (`sample_defi_portfolio_data.csv`) is included to simulate portfolio performance over 10 months.

Columns include:

- `Timestamp`: Monthly time period
- `BTC_Value`, `ETH_Value`, `USDC_Value`, `USDT_Value`: Token values
- `Total_Value`: Cumulative value of portfolio
- `APY`: Annual Percentage Yield
- `ARP`: Annual Return Percentage
- `Impermanent_Loss_%`: Simulated monthly impermanent loss

## Walkthrough Script 

**Intro Scene:**
> “Welcome! This is a simulated DeFi Portfolio Manager, built for showcasing key features that real-world crypto investors might use. Let’s take a quick tour.”

**Scene 1 – Dashboard Overview:**
> “Here you can see real-time token balances, monthly performance, and staking return highlights.”

**Scene 2 – Yield Tracker:**
> “The APY vs ARP graph shows your actual vs expected returns—helping you fine-tune where to stake or move assets.”

**Scene 3 – Security & Risk:**
> “I’ve implemented smart contract audit tracking and MFA (multi-factor authentication) to ensure secure access to your crypto data.”

**Scene 4 – Personalization:**
> “Each user can manage their preferred tokens and portfolio structure. The dashboard reacts accordingly and even tracks impermanent loss.”

**Outro:**
> “This dashboard is a prototype to demonstrate how Web3 + React can create transparent, data-rich financial tools. Thanks for watching!”
